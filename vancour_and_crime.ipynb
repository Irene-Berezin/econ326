A number of Single Room Occupancy and Seniors facilities were considered to be dwellings in 2001, and collective dwellings in 2006. As a result the residents of those buildings would not be considered to be households in 2006. There is a high likelihood that residents of such facilities have low incomes, and there will have been an impact on the count of households considered to have a low income.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A number of changes were made to the census family concept for 2001 which account for some of the increase in the total number of families, single parent families and children living at home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Occupied Dwellings are those with a household living in them. The change to the definition of households (already noted) also affects the number of occupied dwellings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2006 there was a change made to the definition of duplex. While it is still defined as a dwelling in a building with two dwellings, one above the other, in 2001 these were only detached properties.  In 2006 the definition changed so they could be joined to other similar properties. In 2006 Statistics Canada also seem to have identified more duplexes than before.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2006 Statistics Canada conducted the Census with a mail-in or online response. To facilitate this, they identified more secondary addresses in houses. This probably also contributes to the increase from 2001 in the number of duplexes, and the reduction in the number of single-family dwellings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data products that are identified as 20% sample data refer to information that was collected using the long census questionnaire. For the most part, these data were collected from 20% of the households; however they also include some areas, such as First Nations communities and remote areas, where long census form data were collected from 100% of the households.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Data currency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data for Census 2006 was collected in May 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Data accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics Canada is committed to protect the privacy of all Canadians and the confidentiality of the data they provide to us. As part of this commitment, some population counts of geographic areas are adjusted in order to ensure confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counts of the total population are rounded to a base of 5 for any dissemination block having a population less than 15. Population counts for all standard geographic areas above the dissemination block level are derived by summing the adjusted dissemination block counts. The adjustment of dissemination block counts is controlled to ensure that the population counts for dissemination areas will always be within 5 of the actual values. The adjustment has no impact on the population counts of census divisions and large census subdivisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Websites for further information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n",

The result of the survey will not be directly comparable with previous census data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; In 2006 there were changes made to the definition of households. A number of Single Room Occupancy and Seniors facilities were considered to be dwellings in 2001, and collective dwellings in 2006. The City believes a similar change occurred on some properties between 2006 and 2011. This would explain why the numbers of \"Apartments under 5 stories\" has fallen in some locations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that for the first time in 2011, three language questions (knowledge of official languages, home language and mother tongue) were included on the census questionnaire that was administered to 100% of the population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Language data and analysis published for all censuses since 1996 have been based almost exclusively on responses from the long-form census questionnaire administered to 20% of the population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; However, Statistics Canada has observed changes in patterns of response to both the mother tongue and home language questions that appear to have arisen from changes in the placement and context of the language questions on the 2011 Census questionnaire relative to previous censuses. As a result, Canadians appear to have been less inclined than in previous censuses to report languages other than English or French as their only mother tongue, and also more inclined to report multiple languages as their mother tongue and as the language used most often at home. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Data currency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data for Census 2011 was collected in May 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Data accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics Canada is committed to protect the privacy of all Canadians and the confidentiality of the data they provide to us.

As part of this commitment, some population counts of geographic areas are adjusted in order to ensure confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Counts of the total population are rounded to a base of 5 for any dissemination block having a population of less than 15. Population counts for all standard geographic areas above the dissemination block level are derived by summing the adjusted dissemination block counts. The adjustment of dissemination block counts is controlled to ensure that the population counts for dissemination areas will always be within 5 of the actual values. The adjustment has no impact on the population counts of census divisions and large census subdivisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Websites for further information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n",

       "&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Data accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the official ballot markings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: any races that were over voted on a ballor will show all zeros. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2017 by-election was the first by-election since 1992. There were 28 candidates for one Councillor and nine School Trustee positions on the ballot.​&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2018 Vancouver election had a large number of candidates (158), resulting in a longer than usual ballot which caused paper jams in the vote counting machines at some locations. The City completed a verification process which included recounting approximately 57,000 ballots from 50 voting places. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the completion of the verification process, there were minor vote differences between the preliminary results and the recount at 39 locations. The minor vote changes did not change the final election standings and are included in the final election results file. At these 39 locations, there were 164 ballots that were not able to be fed through the machine due to minor paper tears or other wear from being verified by the tabulators. These ballots were counted manually and the votes were manually added to the final results file prior to the final results being published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The count of under votes and over votes on the manually counted ballots during the verification process was not added, however, to the count of over votes and under votes on the final election results file. All other locations are automatically tallied by the ballot tabulating machine for those ballots read by the machine. As a result, there are 34 locations (a total of 164 ballots) where the under vote and over vote count in the final results file will not be the same when compared to the anonymous ballot data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Websites for further information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n",

Bicycles are counted using wire loops fixed to the bike lanes which detect the metal wheels passing over the loops. They are designed and built to ignore the effects of larger metal objects such as cars and trucks. We have checked and calibrated this equipment using counts done by staff on site. Pedestrian count data is collected in a similar manner. The pedestrian detectors respond to changes in heat rather than to metal. The count data was downloaded regularly and was updated monthly. &lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "   &lt;p&gt;We also have portable bike counting tools which utilize pneumatic hoses, like similar equipment used to count vehicles. These are used on bike routes throughout the city and have been used on Pacific Street to count cyclists in the protected bike lanes connecting to the Burrard Bridge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have provided estimates of the number of cyclists who would have used the Burrard Bridge without the protected lanes. We have found that it is possible to estimate the number of cyclist on one bicycle route by measuring the cyclists using another route. The number of cyclist using a route on a given day is affected by season, weather, day of the week and other factors, but collectively the cyclists using one route appear to make their decisions in the same way as the cyclists using another route. We found that this lead to patterns of use that are very similar. In statistical terms, the usage patterns are strongly correlated. We have been using measurements of the Ontario Bike Route to estimate the number of cyclists who would have used the Burrard Bridge had we made no changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Note&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent monthly statistics for the Burrard Bridge are currently available in PDF format only. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=\"file-pdf\" href=\"https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/Bike-lane-stats-by-month.pdf\"&gt;Download the PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n",

These are used on bike routes throughout the city to collect bicycle volumes and have had their accuracy validated using manual counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the Burrard Bridge and Dunsmuir Viaduct, bicycles are counted using wire loops fixed to the bike lanes that detect the metal wheels passing over the loops. They are designed and built to ignore the effects of larger metal objects such as cars and trucks.

Licence RSN is an unique identifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business licences issued to out of town (outside of City of Vancouver) addresses do not have coordinates and will not show up on the map. Not all City of Vancouver addresses have coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small percentage of businesses are issued with a replacement licence in a displayed year due to changes or when business type names were retired during mid-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Address data of some selected business types was not disclosed to provide privacy protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be addresses that do not return coordinates in the geoding process. These records will appear in the Table view but not on the Map. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquor License Application business type does not have Issued Date or Expired Date information because it is interim application for a valid business licence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be some loss of quality from data entry errors. ​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Websites for further information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n",

A business licence can be obtained from the City's Licence Office and is valid for the remainder of the calendar year unless stated otherwise.​&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Note&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective May 6, 2024, the City streamlined its business licence categories, consolidating over 500 categories into fewer than 100. While data from before this date will remain accessible, this dataset post-May 6 is organized according to the new, streamlined categories.

Some business licence categories retained the same name. Business owners will renew their licence at the end of each year and may select a different category from the one they were sorted into. New businesses applying for a licence af​ter the update will also select from the updated categories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business licence records from 2013 to 2024, up to May 3, 2024, with their original categories (BusinessType) are found in &lt;a href=\"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/business-licences-2013-to-2024/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Business licences 2013 to 2024&lt;/a&gt;​​ dataset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/business-licences-1997-to-2012/information/?disjunctive.status&amp;amp;disjunctive.businesssubtype\"&gt;Business licences 1997 to 2012&lt;/a&gt; dataset remains the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective April 12, 2018,  the business license dataset, including historical data files from 1997 forward to the current year, has been updated for home-based businesses. The City has removed the business address from the home-based business license category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Data currency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extract for business licences of the current year is updated daily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Data accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a small chance that a licence number has been used twice. Licence RSN is an unique identifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business licences issued to out of town (outside of City of Vancouver) addresses do not have coordinates and will not show up on the map. Not all City of Vancouver addresses have coordinates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small percentage of businesses are issued with a replacement licence in a displayed year due to changes or when business type names were retired during mid-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Address data of some selected business types was not disclosed to provide privacy protection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be addresses that do not return coordinates in the geoding process. These records will appear in the Table view but not on the Map. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liquor License Application business type does not have Issued Date or Expired Date information because it is interim application for a valid business licence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There may be some loss of quality from data entry errors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Websites for further information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; \n",

Data for City of Vancouver spaces was compiled from various departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; City staff selected the attributes for Primary Use and Ownership for each space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Square Feet and Number of Seats, data reported may have been calculated differently prior to publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is no known error but there may be some loss of quality from data entry errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Websites for further information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/cultural-spaces-online-map.aspx\"&gt;Cultural spaces map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/presentation-culture-plan-strategic-directions-2013-oct.pdf\"&gt;Culture Plan: Strategic Directions 2014-2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/culture-plan-2008-2018.aspx\"&gt;Culture Plan for Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Culture and education      </span></td><td>Open Government Licence - Vancouver</td><td>https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/licence/</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>⋯</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA       </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Point                                              </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </span></td><td>City of Vancouver</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>1942   </span></td><td>False</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>City of Vancouver              </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Arts, Culture, and Community Services - Cultural Services                       </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/open-data-change-log/log/?disjunctive.datasets&amp;amp;sort=logdate&amp;amp;refine.datasetids=cultural-spaces                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>cultural-spaces                                      </span></td></tr>\n",

A number of Single Room Occupancy and Seniors facilities were considered to be dwellings in 2001, and collective dwellings in 2006. As a result the residents of those buildings would not be considered to be households in 2006. There is a high likelihood that residents of such facilities have low incomes, and there will have been an impact on the count of households considered to have a low income.</li><li>A number of changes were made to the census family concept for 2001 which account for some of the increase in the total number of families, single parent families and children living at home.</li><li>Occupied Dwellings are those with a household living in them. The change to the definition of households (already noted) also affects the number of occupied dwellings.</li><li>In 2006 there was a change made to the definition of duplex. While it is still defined as a dwelling in a building with two dwellings, one above the other, in 2001 these were only detached properties.  In 2006 the definition changed so they could be joined to other similar properties. In 2006 Statistics Canada also seem to have identified more duplexes than before.</li><li>In 2006 Statistics Canada conducted the Census with a mail-in or online response. To facilitate this, they identified more secondary addresses in houses. This probably also contributes to the increase from 2001 in the number of duplexes, and the reduction in the number of single-family dwellings.</li><li>Data products that are identified as 20\\% sample data refer to information that was collected using the long census questionnaire. For the most part, these data were collected from 20\\% of the households; however they also include some areas, such as First Nations communities and remote areas, where long census form data were collected from 100\\% of the households.</li></ul></div> <h3>Data currency</h3><div><p>The data for Census 2006 was collected in May 2006.</p></div> <h3>Data accuracy</h3><div><p>Statistics Canada is committed to protect the privacy of all Canadians and the confidentiality of the data they provide to us. As part of this commitment, some population counts of geographic areas are adjusted in order to ensure confidentiality.</p><p>Counts of the total population are rounded to a base of 5 for any dissemination block having a population less than 15. Population counts for all standard geographic areas above the dissemination block level are derived by summing the adjusted dissemination block counts. The adjustment of dissemination block counts is controlled to ensure that the population counts for dissemination areas will always be within 5 of the actual values.

The result of the survey will not be directly comparable with previous census data.</li><li> In 2006 there were changes made to the definition of households. A number of Single Room Occupancy and Seniors facilities were considered to be dwellings in 2001, and collective dwellings in 2006. The City believes a similar change occurred on some properties between 2006 and 2011. This would explain why the numbers of \"Apartments under 5 stories\" has fallen in some locations.</li><li>Note that for the first time in 2011, three language questions (knowledge of official languages, home language and mother tongue) were included on the census questionnaire that was administered to 100\\% of the population.</li><li>Language data and analysis published for all censuses since 1996 have been based almost exclusively on responses from the long-form census questionnaire administered to 20\\% of the population.</li><li> However, Statistics Canada has observed changes in patterns of response to both the mother tongue and home language questions that appear to have arisen from changes in the placement and context of the language questions on the 2011 Census questionnaire relative to previous censuses. As a result, Canadians appear to have been less inclined than in previous censuses to report languages other than English or French as their only mother tongue, and also more inclined to report multiple languages as their mother tongue and as the language used most often at home. </li></ul></div> <h3>Data currency</h3><div><p>The data for Census 2011 was collected in May 2011.</p></div> <h3>Data accuracy</h3><div><p>Statistics Canada is committed to protect the privacy of all Canadians and the confidentiality of the data they provide to us.

       "</div> <h3>Data accuracy</h3><div><p>These are the official ballot markings.<br></p><p>Note: any races that were over voted on a ballor will show all zeros. <br></p><p>The 2017 by-election was the first by-election since 1992. There were 28 candidates for one Councillor and nine School Trustee positions on the ballot.​<br></p><p>The 2018 Vancouver election had a large number of candidates (158), resulting in a longer than usual ballot which caused paper jams in the vote counting machines at some locations. The City completed a verification process which included recounting approximately 57,000 ballots from 50 voting places. <br></p><p>After the completion of the verification process, there were minor vote differences between the preliminary results and the recount at 39 locations. The minor vote changes did not change the final election standings and are included in the final election results file. At these 39 locations, there were 164 ballots that were not able to be fed through the machine due to minor paper tears or other wear from being verified by the tabulators. These ballots were counted manually and the votes were manually added to the final results file prior to the final results being published.</p><p>The count of under votes and over votes on the manually counted ballots during the verification process was not added, however, to the count of over votes and under votes on the final election results file. All other locations are automatically tallied by the ballot tabulating machine for those ballots read by the machine. As a result, there are 34 locations (a total of 164 ballots) where the under vote and over vote count in the final results file will not be the same when compared to the anonymous ballot data.<br></p></div> <h3>Websites for further information</h3><div><ul><li>\n",

Bicycles are counted using wire loops fixed to the bike lanes which detect the metal wheels passing over the loops. They are designed and built to ignore the effects of larger metal objects such as cars and trucks. We have checked and calibrated this equipment using counts done by staff on site. Pedestrian count data is collected in a similar manner. The pedestrian detectors respond to changes in heat rather than to metal. The count data was downloaded regularly and was updated monthly. </p>\n",
       "   <p>We also have portable bike counting tools which utilize pneumatic hoses, like similar equipment used to count vehicles. These are used on bike routes throughout the city and have been used on Pacific Street to count cyclists in the protected bike lanes connecting to the Burrard Bridge. </p><p>We have provided estimates of the number of cyclists who would have used the Burrard Bridge without the protected lanes. We have found that it is possible to estimate the number of cyclist on one bicycle route by measuring the cyclists using another route. The number of cyclist using a route on a given day is affected by season, weather, day of the week and other factors, but collectively the cyclists using one route appear to make their decisions in the same way as the cyclists using another route. We found that this lead to patterns of use that are very similar. In statistical terms, the usage patterns are strongly correlated. We have been using measurements of the Ontario Bike Route to estimate the number of cyclists who would have used the Burrard Bridge had we made no changes. </p></div> <h3>Note</h3><div><p>More recent monthly statistics for the Burrard Bridge are currently available in PDF format only. </p><ul><li><a class=\"file-pdf\" href=\"https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/Bike-lane-stats-by-month.pdf\">Download the PDF</a></li>\n",

       "   <p>On Dunsmuir Street and Hornby Street we are using portable bike counters which utilize pneumatic hoses, similar to equipment to count vehicles. These are used on bike routes throughout the city to collect bicycle volumes and have had their accuracy validated using manual counts.</p><p> On the Burrard Bridge and Dunsmuir Viaduct, bicycles are counted using wire loops fixed to the bike lanes that detect the metal wheels passing over the loops. They are designed and built to ignore the effects of larger metal objects such as cars and trucks. We have checked and calibrated this equipment using counts done by staff on site.</p></div> <h3>Note</h3><div><p>More recent monthly statistics for the bicycle facilities are currently available in PDF format only. </p><ul><li>\n",

The images show what the camera sees.</p></div> <h3>Websites for further information</h3><div><ul><li><a href=\"http://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/traffic-cameras.aspx\">Traffic cameras</a></li></ul></div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & Streets and transportation  & Open Government Licence - Vancouver & https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/licence/ & NA & NA & ⋯ & NA        & Point                                               & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            & City of Vancouver & 191     & False & City of Vancouver               & Engineering Services                                                             & https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/open-data-change-log/log/?disjunctive.datasets\\&amp;sort=logdate\\&amp;refine.datasetids=web-cam-url-links                                     & web-cam-url-links                                    \\\\\n",

A number of Single Room Occupancy and Seniors facilities were considered to be dwellings in 2001, and collective dwellings in 2006. As a result the residents of those buildings would not be considered to be households in 2006. There is a high likelihood that residents of such facilities have low incomes, and there will have been an impact on the count of households considered to have a low income.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A number of changes were made to the census family concept for 2001 which account for some of the increase in the total number of families, single parent families and children living at home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Occupied Dwellings are those with a household living in them. The change to the definition of households (already noted) also affects the number of occupied dwellings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2006 there was a change made to the definition of duplex. While it is still defined as a dwelling in a building with two dwellings, one above the other, in 2001 these were only detached properties.  In 2006 the definition changed so they could be joined to other similar properties. In 2006 Statistics Canada also seem to have identified more duplexes than before.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2006 Statistics Canada conducted the Census with a mail-in or online response. To facilitate this, they identified more secondary addresses in houses. This probably also contributes to the increase from 2001 in the number of duplexes, and the reduction in the number of single-family dwellings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data products that are identified as 20% sample data refer to information that was collected using the long census questionnaire. For the most part, these data were collected from 20% of the households; however they also include some areas, such as First Nations communities and remote areas, where long census form data were collected from 100% of the households.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Data currency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data for Census 2006 was collected in May 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Data accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics Canada is committed to protect the privacy of all Canadians and the confidentiality of the data they provide to us. As part of this commitment, some population counts of geographic areas are adjusted in order to ensure confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counts of the total population are rounded to a base of 5 for any dissemination block having a population less than 15. Population counts for all standard geographic areas above the dissemination block level are derived by summing the adjusted dissemination block counts. The adjustment of dissemination block counts is controlled to ensure that the population counts for dissemination areas will always be within 5 of the actual values. The adjustment has no impact on the population counts of census divisions and large census subdivisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Websites for further information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n",

The result of the survey will not be directly comparable with previous census data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; In 2006 there were changes made to the definition of households. A number of Single Room Occupancy and Seniors facilities were considered to be dwellings in 2001, and collective dwellings in 2006. The City believes a similar change occurred on some properties between 2006 and 2011. This would explain why the numbers of \"Apartments under 5 stories\" has fallen in some locations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note that for the first time in 2011, three language questions (knowledge of official languages, home language and mother tongue) were included on the census questionnaire that was administered to 100% of the population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Language data and analysis published for all censuses since 1996 have been based almost exclusively on responses from the long-form census questionnaire administered to 20% of the population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; However, Statistics Canada has observed changes in patterns of response to both the mother tongue and home language questions that appear to have arisen from changes in the placement and context of the language questions on the 2011 Census questionnaire relative to previous censuses. As a result, Canadians appear to have been less inclined than in previous censuses to report languages other than English or French as their only mother tongue, and also more inclined to report multiple languages as their mother tongue and as the language used most often at home. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Data currency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data for Census 2011 was collected in May 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Data accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics Canada is committed to protect the privacy of all Canadians and the confidentiality of the data they provide to us.

As part of this commitment, some population counts of geographic areas are adjusted in order to ensure confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Counts of the total population are rounded to a base of 5 for any dissemination block having a population of less than 15. Population counts for all standard geographic areas above the dissemination block level are derived by summing the adjusted dissemination block counts. The adjustment of dissemination block counts is controlled to ensure that the population counts for dissemination areas will always be within 5 of the actual values. The adjustment has no impact on the population counts of census divisions and large census subdivisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Websites for further information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n",

       "&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Data accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the official ballot markings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: any races that were over voted on a ballor will show all zeros. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2017 by-election was the first by-election since 1992. There were 28 candidates for one Councillor and nine School Trustee positions on the ballot.​&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2018 Vancouver election had a large number of candidates (158), resulting in a longer than usual ballot which caused paper jams in the vote counting machines at some locations. The City completed a verification process which included recounting approximately 57,000 ballots from 50 voting places. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the completion of the verification process, there were minor vote differences between the preliminary results and the recount at 39 locations. The minor vote changes did not change the final election standings and are included in the final election results file. At these 39 locations, there were 164 ballots that were not able to be fed through the machine due to minor paper tears or other wear from being verified by the tabulators. These ballots were counted manually and the votes were manually added to the final results file prior to the final results being published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The count of under votes and over votes on the manually counted ballots during the verification process was not added, however, to the count of over votes and under votes on the final election results file. All other locations are automatically tallied by the ballot tabulating machine for those ballots read by the machine. As a result, there are 34 locations (a total of 164 ballots) where the under vote and over vote count in the final results file will not be the same when compared to the anonymous ballot data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Websites for further information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n",

These points were created for the acquisition of the City's 2002 orthophotos and have been marginally modified since then (in 2004, 2006 and 2008).  Modifications occurred in some, but probably not all, areas where there were significant changes in the terrain due to development.  However, these points should not be taken to be authoritative or anything more than approximate because of the process by which they have been created. \n",

Bicycles are counted using wire loops fixed to the bike lanes which detect the metal wheels passing over the loops. They are designed and built to ignore the effects of larger metal objects such as cars and trucks. We have checked and calibrated this equipment using counts done by staff on site. Pedestrian count data is collected in a similar manner. The pedestrian detectors respond to changes in heat rather than to metal. The count data was downloaded regularly and was updated monthly. &lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "   &lt;p&gt;We also have portable bike counting tools which utilize pneumatic hoses, like similar equipment used to count vehicles. These are used on bike routes throughout the city and have been used on Pacific Street to count cyclists in the protected bike lanes connecting to the Burrard Bridge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have provided estimates of the number of cyclists who would have used the Burrard Bridge without the protected lanes. We have found that it is possible to estimate the number of cyclist on one bicycle route by measuring the cyclists using another route. The number of cyclist using a route on a given day is affected by season, weather, day of the week and other factors, but collectively the cyclists using one route appear to make their decisions in the same way as the cyclists using another route. We found that this lead to patterns of use that are very similar. In statistical terms, the usage patterns are strongly correlated. We have been using measurements of the Ontario Bike Route to estimate the number of cyclists who would have used the Burrard Bridge had we made no changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Note&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent monthly statistics for the Burrard Bridge are currently available in PDF format only. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=\"file-pdf\" href=\"https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/Bike-lane-stats-by-month.pdf\"&gt;Download the PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n",

These are used on bike routes throughout the city to collect bicycle volumes and have had their accuracy validated using manual counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the Burrard Bridge and Dunsmuir Viaduct, bicycles are counted using wire loops fixed to the bike lanes that detect the metal wheels passing over the loops. They are designed and built to ignore the effects of larger metal objects such as cars and trucks. We have checked and calibrated this equipment using counts done by staff on site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Note&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent monthly statistics for the bicycle facilities are currently available in PDF format only. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n",

The City has removed the business address from the home-based business license category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Data currency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a static dataset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Data accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a small chance that a licence number has been used twice. Licence RSN is an unique identifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business licences issued to out of town (outside of City of Vancouver) addresses do not have coordinates and will not show up on the map. Not all City of Vancouver addresses have coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small percentage of businesses are issued with a replacement licence in a displayed year due to changes or when business type names were retired during mid-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Address data of some selected business types was not disclosed to provide privacy protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be addresses that do not return coordinates in the geoding process. These records will appear in the Table view but not on the Map. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquor License Application business type does not have Issued Date or Expired Date information because it is interim application for a valid business licence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be some loss of quality from data entry errors. ​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Websites for further information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n",

Not all City of Vancouver addresses have coordinates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small percentage of businesses are issued with a replacement licence in a displayed year due to changes or when business type names were retired during mid-year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Address data of some selected business types was not disclosed to provide privacy protection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be addresses that do not return coordinates in the geoding process.

A business licence can be obtained from the City's Licence Office and is valid for the remainder of the calendar year unless stated otherwise.​&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Note&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective May 6, 2024, the City streamlined its business licence categories, consolidating over 500 categories into fewer than 100. While data from before this date will remain accessible, this dataset post-May 6 is organized according to the new, streamlined categories.

Some business licence categories retained the same name. Business owners will renew their licence at the end of each year and may select a different category from the one they were sorted into. New businesses applying for a licence af​ter the update will also select from the updated categories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business licence records from 2013 to 2024, up to May 3, 2024, with their original categories (BusinessType) are found in &lt;a href=\"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/business-licences-2013-to-2024/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Business licences 2013 to 2024&lt;/a&gt;​​ dataset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/business-licences-1997-to-2012/information/?disjunctive.status&amp;amp;disjunctive.businesssubtype\"&gt;Business licences 1997 to 2012&lt;/a&gt; dataset remains the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective April 12, 2018,  the business license dataset, including historical data files from 1997 forward to the current year, has been updated for home-based businesses.

Licence RSN is an unique identifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business licences issued to out of town (outside of City of Vancouver) addresses do not have coordinates and will not show up on the map. Not all City of Vancouver addresses have coordinates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small percentage of businesses are issued with a replacement licence in a displayed year due to changes or when business type names were retired during mid-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Address data of some selected business types was not disclosed to provide privacy protection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be addresses that do not return coordinates in the geoding process. These records will appear in the Table view but not on the Map. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liquor License Application business type does not have Issued Date or Expired Date information because it is interim application for a valid business licence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There may be some loss of quality from data entry errors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Websites for further information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; \n",

A number of Single Room Occupancy and Seniors facilities were considered to be dwellings in 2001, and collective dwellings in 2006. As a result the residents of those buildings would not be considered to be households in 2006. There is a high likelihood that residents of such facilities have low incomes, and there will have been an impact on the count of households considered to have a low income.</li><li>A number of changes were made to the census family concept for 2001 which account for some of the increase in the total number of families, single parent families and children living at home.</li><li>Occupied Dwellings are those with a household living in them. The change to the definition of households (already noted) also affects the number of occupied dwellings.</li><li>In 2006 there was a change made to the definition of duplex. While it is still defined as a dwelling in a building with two dwellings, one above the other, in 2001 these were only detached properties.  In 2006 the definition changed so they could be joined to other similar properties. In 2006 Statistics Canada also seem to have identified more duplexes than before.</li><li>In 2006 Statistics Canada conducted the Census with a mail-in or online response. To facilitate this, they identified more secondary addresses in houses. This probably also contributes to the increase from 2001 in the number of duplexes, and the reduction in the number of single-family dwellings.</li><li>Data products that are identified as 20% sample data refer to information that was collected using the long census questionnaire. For the most part, these data were collected from 20% of the households; however they also include some areas, such as First Nations communities and remote areas, where long census form data were collected from 100% of the households.</li></ul></div> <h3>Data currency</h3><div><p>The data for Census 2006 was collected in May 2006.</p></div> <h3>Data accuracy</h3><div><p>Statistics Canada is committed to protect the privacy of all Canadians and the confidentiality of the data they provide to us.

The result of the survey will not be directly comparable with previous census data.</li><li> In 2006 there were changes made to the definition of households. A number of Single Room Occupancy and Seniors facilities were considered to be dwellings in 2001, and collective dwellings in 2006. The City believes a similar change occurred on some properties between 2006 and 2011. This would explain why the numbers of \"Apartments under 5 stories\" has fallen in some locations.</li><li>Note that for the first time in 2011, three language questions (knowledge of official languages, home language and mother tongue) were included on the census questionnaire that was administered to 100% of the population.</li><li>Language data and analysis published for all censuses since 1996 have been based almost exclusively on responses from the long-form census questionnaire administered to 20% of the population.</li><li> However, Statistics Canada has observed changes in patterns of response to both the mother tongue and home language questions that appear to have arisen from changes in the placement and context of the language questions on the 2011 Census questionnaire relative to previous censuses. As a result, Canadians appear to have been less inclined than in previous censuses to report languages other than English or French as their only mother tongue, and also more inclined to report multiple languages as their mother tongue and as the language used most often at home. </li></ul></div> <h3>Data currency</h3><div><p>The data for Census 2011 was collected in May 2011.</p></div> <h3>Data accuracy</h3><div><p>Statistics Canada is committed to protect the privacy of all Canadians and the confidentiality of the data they provide to us.

There were 28 candidates for one Councillor and nine School Trustee positions on the ballot.​<br></p><p>The 2018 Vancouver election had a large number of candidates (158), resulting in a longer than usual ballot which caused paper jams in the vote counting machines at some locations. The City completed a verification process which included recounting approximately 57,000 ballots from 50 voting places. <br></p><p>After the completion of the verification process, there were minor vote differences between the preliminary results and the recount at 39 locations. The minor vote changes did not change the final election standings and are included in the final election results file. At these 39 locations, there were 164 ballots that were not able to be fed through the machine due to minor paper tears or other wear from being verified by the tabulators. These ballots were counted manually and the votes were manually added to the final results file prior to the final results being published.</p><p>The count of under votes and over votes on the manually counted ballots during the verification process was not added, however, to the count of over votes and under votes on the final election results file. All other locations are automatically tallied by the ballot tabulating machine for those ballots read by the machine. As a result, there are 34 locations (a total of 164 ballots) where the under vote and over vote count in the final results file will not be the same when compared to the anonymous ballot data.<br></p></div> <h3>Websites for further information</h3><div><ul><li>\\n         <a href=\"https://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/municipalElectionResults.htm\">Municipal election results</a></li><li>\\n         <a href=\"https://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/votingPlaces.htm\">Voting Places</a></li><li>\\n         <a href=\"https://vancouver.ca/your-government/civic-elections.aspx\">Municipal elections</a></li><li>\\n         <a href=\"http://www.bclaws.ca/Recon/document/ID/freeside/vanch_00\">Vancouver Charter</a>\\n         <ul><ul><li>\\n                  <a href=\"http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/LOC/complete/statreg/--%20V%20--/Vancouver%20Charter%20%5bSBC%201953%5d%20c.%2055/00_Act/vanch_02.xml#section24.\">Section 24: Non-resident property electors</a></li><li>\\n                  <a href=\"http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/LOC/complete/statreg/--%20V%20--/Vancouver%20Charter%20%5bSBC%201953%5d%20c.%2055/00_Act/vanch_02.xml#section72.\">Section 72: Mail ballot voting</a></li></ul></ul></li><li>\\n         <a href=\"http://bylaws.vancouver.ca/9070c.PDF\">City of Vancouver Election By-Law No. 9070</a>\\n         <ul><ul><li>Section 3.4-3.8 for special voting opportunities</li><li>Section 4 for mail ballot procedure<br></li></ul></ul></li></ul></div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "22  <div><p>This dataset comes from the Burrard Bridge Lane Reallocation Trial and provides a summary of the data collected between June 2009 and December 2010. </p><h3>Measuring Bicycles and Pedestrians</h3><p>On the Burrard Bridge, and at several other locations in the city, bicycles are counted using permanently installed detection equipment. Bicycles are counted using wire loops fixed to the bike lanes which detect the metal wheels passing over the loops. They are designed and built to ignore the effects of larger metal objects such as cars and trucks. We have checked and calibrated this equipment using counts done by staff on site. Pedestrian count data is collected in a similar manner. The pedestrian detectors respond to changes in heat rather than to metal. The count data was downloaded regularly and was updated monthly. </p>\\n   <p>We also have portable bike counting tools which utilize pneumatic hoses, like similar equipment used to count vehicles. These are used on bike routes throughout the city and have been used on Pacific Street to count cyclists in the protected bike lanes connecting to the Burrard Bridge. </p><p>We have provided estimates of the number of cyclists who would have used the Burrard Bridge without the protected lanes. We have found that it is possible to estimate the number of cyclist on one bicycle route by measuring the cyclists using another route. The number of cyclist using a route on a given day is affected by season, weather, day of the week and other factors, but collectively the cyclists using one route appear to make their decisions in the same way as the cyclists using another route. We found that this lead to patterns of use that are very similar. In statistical terms, the usage patterns are strongly correlated. We have been using measurements of the Ontario Bike Route to estimate the number of cyclists who would have used the Burrard Bridge had we made no changes. </p></div> <h3>Note</h3><div><p>More recent monthly statistics for the Burrard Bridge are currently available in PDF format only. </p><ul><li><a class=\"file-pdf\" href=\"https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/Bike-lane-stats-by-month.pdf\">Download the PDF</a></li>\\n</ul></div> <h3>Data currency</h3><div><p>​This is a static dataset representing data collected between June 2009 and December 2010. </p></div>  <h3>Websites for further information</h3><div><ul><li><a href=\"https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/biking.aspx\">Cycling in Vancouver</a></li><li><a href=\"https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/how-we-collect-bike-volumes.aspx\">​How we collect bike volumes on separated bike lanes</a></li></ul></div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Staff record the times when their vhicle enters and exits the study area. Numerous runs are made by staff at different times of day.</p><h3>Measuring cyclist volumes</h3>\\n   <p>On Dunsmuir Street and Hornby Street we are using portable bike counters which utilize pneumatic hoses, similar to equipment to count vehicles. These are used on bike routes throughout the city to collect bicycle volumes and have had their accuracy validated using manual counts.</p><p> On the Burrard Bridge and Dunsmuir Viaduct, bicycles are counted using wire loops fixed to the bike lanes that detect the metal wheels passing over the loops. They are designed and built to ignore the effects of larger metal objects such as cars and trucks. We have checked and calibrated this equipment using counts done by staff on site.</p></div> <h3>Note</h3><div><p>More recent monthly statistics for the bicycle facilities are currently available in PDF format only. </p><ul><li>\\n         <a class=\"file-pdf\" href=\"https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/Bike-lane-stats-by-month.pdf\">Download the PDF</a></li></ul></div> <h3>Data currency</h3><div><p>​​This is a static dataset representing data collected between 2009 and 2012.</p></div>  <h3>Websites for further information</h3><div><div>\\n   <ul><li>\\n         <a href=\"https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/biking.aspx\">Cycling in Vancouver</a></li><li>\\n         <a href=\"https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/how-we-collect-bike-volumes.aspx\">​How we collect bike volumes on separated bike lanes</a></li></ul></div></div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

In deciding where to install disability zones, we look for spaces or metered spaces that are easier for people with disabilities to access. Any vehicle displaying a permit for people with disabilities (a SPARC placard or recognized equivalent) may use them. Disability zones are identified with signs displaying the universal disability symbol and disability meters are identified with blue meter heads as well as signs.</p></div></div>  <h3>Data currency</h3><div><div>\\n   <p>The extract for this dataset is updated weekly.

The images show what the camera sees.</p></div> <h3>Websites for further information</h3><div><ul><li><a href=\"http://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/traffic-cameras.aspx\">Traffic cameras</a></li></ul></div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "187 <div><p>​This dataset provides the ranges of hourly rates of pay for all City job classifications, corresponding job titles and the breakdown of staff by sex within these classifications. The dataset does not include information from the Vancouver Public Library and the Vancouver Police Department.<br></p></div> <h3>Note</h3><div><p>This dataset was published in 2019 as ‘workforce pay rates and gender’. In 2022, the dataset name was corrected to ‘Workforce pay rates and sex’, which is a more accurate reflection of the data categories available at the time of collection (see below for more details). Efforts are now underway to improve and increase transparency of data collection methods, and update categories to be inclusive of those outside the gender binary, and reflect gender instead of sex.<br></p> \\n    <p>Sex breakdown and salary ranges are only shown for a classification or specific position title when there are 10 or more people in that group. This is necessary in order to preserve confidentiality. If there are fewer than 10, the groups (within the same group level) are aggregated until the total exceeds the minimum number threshold.</p><p>To explain the aggregation in more details:\\n</p><p>Data for each year is aggregated separately. If necessary, groups are aggregated in this order: <i>Exempt/Union</i>, <i>Classification</i> and then by <i>Position title</i>. Multiple aggregations (of the same group level) may take place in order to meet the minimum number requirement of 10 people. These aggregations are labelled with <i>*Multiple</i>. The field Data Category explains whether a row represents a detailed group with data, an aggregated group with data, or a group where detailed data is suppressed (reported as part of an aggregation).</p></div> \\n<h3>Data accuracy</h3>\\n<div><p>​The minimum and maximum hourly rates listed reflect the current rates of pay for the classification for the effective year. For the full salary range of each classification, refer to the relevant Collective Agreement \\n      <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2WL8QUu\">here​</a>.<br></p>\\n   <p>The City’s employee database currently contains the sex designations ‘male’ or ‘female’ for employees. Historically the sex information was indicated by the managers on hiring forms, and has not been explicitly asked of or verified by the employee. As such, not all employees have been provided designations as male or female, and so the total count for “Male” and “Female” combined may not equal the total employee count.</p>\\n   <p>\\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kX5vNmat7Q\">Sex is typically understood to be a biological concept, distinct from gender which is a social concept</a>. With updates in technology and data collection methods, the City is moving towards collecting self-disclosed gender information (woman, man, gender-diverse etc.) for all employees.
