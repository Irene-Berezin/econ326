### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: CREATE A BRANCH! ⚠️

If editing the main project files, **DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN. Create a new branch, make changes there, then merge the branch after clearing merge conflicts. This will make merge conflicts significantly easier to handle.** `main` is currently unprotected. If we are frequently getting merge conflicts, I will protect it.
