### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: AVOIDING MERGE CONFLICTS! ‚ö†Ô∏è

The project is stored on `main`. When editing the `main` branch project files, **pull all changes before making any changes to the files**. Alternatively, create a new branch, make changes there, then merge the branch after clearing merge conflicts once you're finished working. This will make merge conflicts significantly easier to handle. Note that, if you make a branch, `main` will only be updated once you merge the branch, so avoid leaving branches stagnant and **merge immediately after you're done**.
